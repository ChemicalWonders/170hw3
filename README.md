#This is the README file for Kevin Chan's 170 homework#3

##So far, I have finished the following things:

1. Reading from command line to record the amount of m and n
values that I need. n is for creating the n x n world, and m
is for obsticles and rewards.

2. Creating the n x n grid after reading in the values of m and n.

3. Stopping the program if the value of argc is 3 < because we need
the command line to say "./a.out n m".
It will print out "Usage: ./a.out n m" if values are not printed out.



##Things I have yet to finish before I update the README:

1. The start space is created and initated, but does not print out.

2. Completing the value iterations, and finishing the final grid.
